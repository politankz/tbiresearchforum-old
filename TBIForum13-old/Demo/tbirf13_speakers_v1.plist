		<string>Dr. O’Donovan is a Society in Science: Branco Weiss Fellow at the San Francisco VA Medical Center and the Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Her research is focused on uncovering how traumatic stress exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder increase risk for chronic diseases of aging such as cardiovascular, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. To this end, she examines the effects of psychological stress on indices and mechanisms of biological aging, including telomere length, an index of biological age, as well as oxidative stress and inflammatory activity, which are mechanisms of biological aging. Her work to date has uncovered potential psychological and biological mechanisms linking psychological stress exposure with accelerated biological aging. In her current work, she is examining if exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat drives accelerated aging in the aftermath of trauma exposure. Dr. O’Donovan received her PhD in Clinical Psychobiology from University College Dublin.</string>
