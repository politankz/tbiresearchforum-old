		<string>Background: Complete information guiding use of outcome and assessment measures has not always been available. This can lead to creation of “home-made” measures when established measures are available.  Using non-established measures makes it difficult to replicate or compare study findings. Clinicians need accurate and complete information for measure selection, administration, and scoring, and interpretation to effectively describe patient status and outcomes.

Methodology: The Center for Outcome Measurement in Brain Injury (COMBI) website (http://www.tbims.org/combi/) created by Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in collaboration with 20 other centers/researchers works to create one central location for brain injury researchers to locate appropriate outcome scales to utilize in their research. Beginning in 2012, in conjunction with the Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation, a Tools for Clinical Use section has been developed to spotlight brain injury scales located on the COMBI. The Clinical Tools spotlight has thus far included the Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS), Disability Rating Scale (DRS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Mayo Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4). For the purposes of this poster presentation, these four outcome measures will be further described.</string>

		<string>Background: Following a TBI, stress can affect and impact the recovery of a person for years to come. Walking and exercise are used by many people as a stress management tool. People often find themselves more calm and peaceful and able to manage their daily lives better when they exercise on a regular basis. With this in mind, as well as input from focus groups conducted with people with a TBI, a home based, 12 week goal oriented, walking program was created as a potential way to combat perceived stress.  

Methodology:  After a preliminary safety and baseline assessment, subjects were randomized into either a walking or nutrition group for the first 12 weeks of the study. While the walking module of the study was considered the intervention, the nutrition component was regarded as the control group. Using a pedometer to measure their daily steps, subjects assigned to the walking program completed an initial baseline week where the subject continued with a typical week of walking. Following that week, they were given an individualized goal with a 5% increase from their baseline week average. Subsequently a gradual 5% increase in that goal was given by an assigned coach each week, until the subject reached a 40% increase in week eight and maintained that increase for the last four weeks of the study. For the nutrition module, subjects were educated in areas of healthy eating that they deemed important to them. After the first 12 weeks, subjects were switched over to the opposing program that they had not yet completed.  A coach was assigned to contact the subjects each week in order to encourage and troubleshoot with them any problems they were encountering with meeting either their nutrition or walking goals. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) data was collected as a self-report questionnaire at 3 time points in the study: baseline, 12 weeks after baseline and 24 weeks after the baseline appointment. Data was analyzed to determine if either or both of the two groups contributed to less perceived stress for the participant.

Results: Complete data at all three time points was available for 69 subjects, who were typically many years post injury. Results showed that regardless of when the walking module was completed within the research study, either immediately following the baseline appointment or after the initial 12 weeks of the study, stress perception decreased for participants. The nutrition module did not impact perceived stress for subjects. 

Conclusion: Walking and exercise can be utilized as effective stress management tools for people with a TBI.</string>

		<string>INTRODUCTION:  TBI due go blast injury (BI) has been the signature medical problem of the OEF/OIF campaigns.  An issue of importance is whether pure blast injury (BI) without Direct Head Trauma (DHT) produces brain injury similar to that with DHT.  This study compares the Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS) produced by these two types of mechanisms of TBI over a period of up to 8 years after TBI.

OBJECTIVE:  Compare symptoms of the PCS produced by primary and secondary blast injury with that produced by DHT within periods of 1-4 and 5-8 years post-injury. 

METHODS:  The Veterans Administration authorized free medical care for 5 years to all OEF/OIF Veterans.  Those who opted for this program in the Oklahoma City area were evaluated in an induction clinic and a general health screening Questionnaire which included information about TBI was administered by a medical professional.   Those with a deployment-related TBI (D-TBI) were referred to a special TBI clinic established specifically to deal with DTBI.  This clinic was staffed by M.D. and Physician Assistant personnel with specific training for TBI.  A second screening questionnaire was administered by these personnel, which included information about D-TBI and TBI that may have occurred before or after deployment.  The questionnaire included questions about symptoms that relate to past and current occurrence of symptoms related to the PCS, psychiatric problems, as well as current marital and employment situation.  The symptoms queried were graded as none, mild, moderate, severe and very severe. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was employed to assess depression.   The Longitudinal aspect of the study was achieved by comparing those with injury 1-4 years versus 5-8 years prior to being seen in the TBI clinic. 

TBI due to blast was divided into four categories as specifies by the Army Medical System as:  1. Primary – pure blast with no DHT, 2. Secondary – Blast injury with dust or sand but no DHT from an object large enough to produce injury by itself, 3. Tertiary – Blast with DHT due to the blast, and 4. Quarternary – Blast with other bodily injury.  A fifth category of TBI due to DHT with no blast involved is added here. The data here deals with comparison of PCS symptoms in  Veterans suffering Primary or Secondary blast injury (#1 and 2) versus those with DHT only (#5) at periods of 1-4 years and 5-8 years after D-TBI. 

The symptoms chosen to represent the PCS include:  1. Headache, 2. Dizziness, 3. Balance Difficulty, 4. Poor coordination, 5. Difficulty with Decisions, and 6. The BDI. The Liklihood-Ratio Chi-Square test was used to compare groups of Blast versus DHT subjects as well comparison of symptoms within groups at 1-4 and 5-8 years after TBI.  For symptoms #1-5,  three categories of none, mild-moderate, and severe-very severe were employed.  For the BDI score (range 0=60), categories of none (0-9), minimal (10-15), and moderate + (16+ ) were used. 

RESULTS:  The OEF/OIF program evaluated 5782 Veterans between June 12008 and April 2011 of which 1332 had a possible D-TBI and were referred to the TBI clinic. The results deal with the first 500 subjects with a D-TBI seen.  In the groups 1-4 years post-TBI, there were 56 blast and 63 DHT subjects. In the groups 5-8 years post-TBI, there were 28 blast and 50 DHT subjects.   In comparing the primary/secondary blast versus the DHT subjects, there was no difference in the occurrence of symptoms #1-5 representing the PCS with the exception of mild/moderate poor coordination in those 5-8 years post-TBI, which occurred 1.7 times as often in the group of DHT as opposed to blast subjects.   There was no difference between groups in the occurrence of Depression. The results will be presented in detail 

CONCLUSION:  Blast injury without head trauma and direct head trauma both produce a PCS which essentially the same regardless of the etiology of the TBI.</string>

		<string>We evaluated the process of evaluation and acceptance of referrals made to the VA Palo Alto Health Care System Polytrauma System of Care (VAPAHCS PSC). Acceptance decisions are based on identification of needs, availability, accessibility, and prioritization of the services to meet the needs of traumatic brain injured (TBI) patients.

Our purpose was to evaluate the quality of the PSC clinical placement recommendations. When we compared the patients accepted into the PSC compared to those that are alternatively redirected, significant differences were appropriate. Additionally, we found that the patients that were alternatively redirected had the majority of their needs met with the services they received through other VA agencies. The top rehabilitation needs in alternatively redirected patients were psychological support, mobility/PT, and communication/SLP.</string>

		<string>Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and neurological deficits that can persist more than a year after injury. The current preliminary study used 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to determine the nature of cognitive impairments and their relationship with chronic metabolic changes in mild TBI (mTBI) patients with chronic post-concussive symptoms.  This study aims to see if potential metabolic changes might explain reported differences in cognitive function between mTBI patients with similar injuries. 

Methodology: This preliminary study included 13 mTBI subjects and 6 control subjects.  Neuropsychological tests measured intelligence, processing speed, abstract reasoning, attention, language, and visual construction.  MRSI was used to measure cerebral metabolism.

Results: It was found that performance on measures of cognitive functioning were predictive of alterations in cerebral metabolism. Specifically, significance tests suggested that performance on tasks of non-verbal abstraction and visual construction had an influence on the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) ratio (NAA/Cr) within the frontal white matter for mTBI subjects, with little to no impact for controls. This same pattern emerged for mTBI subjects on tasks of processing speed, phonemic and semantic language fluency, and mental flexibility, all of which predicted the NAA/Cr ratio within the thalami but again was not present for controls.  On attention tasks, there was a significant relationship between the choline (Cho) to creatine (Cr) ratio (Cho/Cr) within the corpus callosum and the parieto-occipital white matter for mTBI subjects, with little or no impact for controls.  

Conclusions: The findings from the current study suggest that differential performance on cognitive tests in individuals with chronic post-concussive syndrome may be due, at least in part, to differences in cerebral metabolic changes as measured by MRSI.  These findings may also provide some impetus for exploring ways to alter cerebral metabolism as a treatment option for those who continue to struggle with cognitive difficulties post-injury.</string>

		<string>Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in cognitive, emotional, behavioral and neurological deficits that can persist more than a year after injury. Studies utilizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) often fail to demonstrate differences in pathology between mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients with and without persistent neurocognitive deficits (i.e., post-concussive symptoms), though 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) studies suggest metabolic changes may be different in individuals with similar mild head injuries.  Therefore, the current preliminary study aimed to use MRSI to determine if prolonged cerebral metabolic alterations occur in individuals with post-concussion syndrome following a mild TBI (mTBI) and if regions of altered cerebral metabolism are associated with changes in psychological functioning, including mood and coping style. 

Methodology: This preliminary study included 13 individuals with mTBI and 6 control subjects.  Psychological tests were administered (when?) and measured domains including mood, perceived quality of life (QOL), and coping style. 

Results: Differences in mood and QOL were found between groups, with mTBI being predictive of increased anxiety and depression, and poorer QOL.  However, mood and QOL did not influence cerebral metabolic rates. Moreover, it was found that coping style was predictive of alterations in cerebral metabolism. Specifically, significance tests suggested that the “accepting-responsibility” coping style had an influence on the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) ratio within the corpus callosum for mTBI subjects, with little impact for controls. 

Conclusions:  The findings from the current study suggest that mTBI contributes to increased depression and anxiety and decreased QOL. These results also support the utility of MRS in the mTBI population, as decreases in NAA-based metabolic ratios have been identified in the mTBI population.  Understanding the possible relationship between cerebral metabolic and psychological changes may elucidate some reasons why some individuals experience chronic post-concussive psychological symptoms following mTBI and others do not.</string>

		<string>Traumatic brain injury (TBI), vision impairment (VI) secondary to TBI, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common in US military personnel. Many of the TBIs from the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are blast-related (BR) injuries that occur from proximity to an explosion. Non-blast related (NBR) TBI is due to automobile accidents, falls, assaults, and other causes. Civilians are also vulnerable to TBI, most often from NBR causes. PTSD in civilians arises from numerous non-combat related sources. The post-concussive symptoms that arise after TBI overlap and are often difficult to distinguish from PTSD symptoms. Documentation of VI after TBI is increasing but little is known about the association of VI and PTSD. This study examines the relationships between TBI mechanisms (BR or NBR), VI, and PTSD.</string>

		<string>Traumatic cervical spinal cord injury with comorbid traumatic brain injury (TBI/SCI) is a devastating but underdiagnosed condition that is often accompanied by trauma to multiple internal organs. This poly-trauma may prolong the patients stay in rehabilitation and often has an adverse effect on a successful recovery of motor and cognitive function. Treatment options can influence how well a patient recovers from the injury, yet there is no standard of care for patients with these combined injuries. To address this issue, a collaboration between physicians and basic scientists was initiated to reverse-translate this syndrome into a preclinical model to facilitate testing of current pharmacological treatments that may target recovery of motor and cognitive function. Our approach consisted of parallel research efforts on the clinical and preclinical side. Clinically, we performed retrospective data mining of dual diagnosis patient records to characterize the impairment level and therapeutic features of these patients for inclusion in a novel animal model. The initial preclinical animal model-development aimed to reproduce forelimb and hindlimb deficits similar to those seen in dual-diagnosis patients (Inoue et al., submitted). The present abstract reports the clinical research component of this collaboration to inform future efforts to test the impact of medication history on recovery from dual diagnosis. We performed retrospective data collection from de- identified patient records from Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (SCVMC, n=14) and the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS, n=10) for patients with a dual diagnosis of TBI and SCI at the time of admission (between 1989 and 2010). Clinical data was curated from admission and discharge notes, ICD-9 codes, medication lists, and Functional Independent Measure (FIM) scores. The database currently includes data on injury parameters, surgical procedures, diagnostic findings, physical and neurological exams, rehabilitation assessment plans, and medications administered at the time of admission and discharge. Preliminary results from querying the clinical component of the database revealed that most patients (n = 19) received treatment for the management of neurogenic bowel (e.g. docusate, senna, and bisacodyl), together with mild analgesics, antacids, and bronchodilators. In addition, assessment of FIM scores revealed a general trend toward improvement at discharge with large variability in the level of improvement. Future work will include determining whether the variability in FIM scores could be due to a particular drug treatment or other factors. Through ongoing development of this clinical database we hope to provide support for pharmacological therapeutics that may impact motor and cognitive recovery of function in dual-diagnosis patients.</string>

		<string>Background: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has often been reported to cause damage to axons within white matter, especially within the fibers of the callosal commissure even in mild (mTBI) cases.  However, recent reports analyzing patients having mTBI injuries with blast etiology seem to indicate that there is little or no damage within the callosum in the chronic stage of injury.  We collected multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) data from a small group of mTBI patients from recent military conflicts, a majority with blast injuries, in order to characterize structural features of the mid-callosal fibers relative to a matched control population and to estimate deficits in the mTBI population.

Methodology:  A 1.5 T Phillips MR scanner was used to image 16 mTBI patients, veterans from OIF/OEF/OND conflicts, where 8 had blast as the primary cause of mTBI and 5 others had experienced concussive blast in combat.  An age, sex, handedness, and education-matched control group of 27 subjects (14 veterans) were also imaged along with 60 more normal controls for testing imaging properties reliability.  MR imaging sequences collected included diffusion imaging (DTI) for evaluating fiber integrity, magnetization transfer (MTR) and T1 imaging for estimating myelination, T2* GRE for imaging hemosiderin deposits, and T1 imaging for automated morphological analysis using C8 software.

Results:  There was a significant group deficit in patient diffusion scores (FA and MD) only in the anterior mid-body area and a moderate trend towards deficit in myelination scores (T1 and MTR) in the callosal mid body, but no callosal regional area differences or clear GRE deficits anywhere.  However only three of the 16 subjects had individually significant abnormalities (uncorrected) in the anterior mid-body in any of the imaging modalities, with most subjects only showing at best weak deficit trends.  Further, when the covariates of intracranial volume and overall post-traumatic checklist (PCL) scores were added to the analysis, the apparent group deficits in the anterior midbody callosum images of the patients completely disappeared.

Conclusion:  We find no evidence of TBI-related deficits in the mid-sagittal corpus callosum, despite the fact that 10/16 patients of our sample experienced a loss of consciousness from their mTBI.  However the patient group differed from the matched controls in several additional respects possibly relevant to the results: the patients suffered from higher levels of chronic pain, sleep disorders, and tinnitus in addition to having experienced more combat (and post traumatic stress) than did the controls.</string>

		<string>Background: There is a great unmet medical need for more efficacious treatments for traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI occurs in two stages; the first stage is due to mechanical damage from the impact or blast, and the second occurs as an inflammatory response that includes blood-brain barrier breakdown, edema, excitotoxicity, and free radical generation leading to increases in inflammatory cytokines and microglia cells. Because the second stage occurs after the initial injury, it represents a window for clinical intervention.  Extensive data from studies of ischemic stroke have shown that either pre- or post-conditioning with diverse stimuli including brief ischemia or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce a powerful neuroprotective response that reduces the extent of neuronal injury in animal models. This phenomenon has been referred to as “ischemic tolerance”.  Neuroprotection from ischemic tolerance or conditioning appears to result from a common mechanism that results in reprogramming the response to injury and triggers expression of new genes and protein synthesis.  We previously showed that post-injury treatment with LPS from Escherichia coli or with lipooligosaccharide (LOS) from Neisseria meningitidis reduced the death of neuronal cells in an in vitro scratch model of TBI (Bingham et al., Brain Res. Bull. 85, 403–409, 2011).  Herein we describe our recent findings (Bingham et al., J. Neuroimmunol, in press) regarding the effect of intravenous (IV) or intranasal (IN) administration of E. coli LPS and N. meningitidis LOS on levels of cerebral inflammatory cells and circulating blood cells in a rat model of neuroinflammation induced by intrastriatal injection of IL-1β to mimic the second stage of TBI. 

Methodology: Inflammation was induced by stereotaxic injection of IL-1β into the brain of anesthetized rats. Injury and treatment groups had a minimum of 12 animals and control groups had 6 animals. LPS or LOS (500 μg/kg) was administered IV via the tail vein or IN 2 h pre- or post-injection of IL-1β. The rats were euthanized 12 h following IL-1β injection. Brain sections were immunostained with antibody to ED-1, a microglia cell marker, and analyzed microscopically. Cells in whole blood were assessed with a VetScan HM2 analyzer, and cytokine levels in sera were analyzed with a Bio-Plex system.

Results: Pre- and post-injury IV treatment with LPS and LOS statistically significantly reduced (from approximately 45 to 70%) the ED-1 positive microglia cells proximal to the site of injection of IL-1β in the brain. IN pre-treatment with LPS or LOS showed a statistical trend towards reducing microglia. Pre- and post-treatment IV with LOS also increased circulating levels of IL-2 and IL-4, whereas IN post-treatment with LPS reduced levels of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IFN-γ. The number of circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes were reduced.

Conclusion: There is considerable evidence that the neurodestructive capabilities of microglia play an important role in pathological states including brain injury and trauma through the release of toxic mediators and by increasing inflammatory infiltrates. Our results demonstrated the potential therapeutic effect of IV administration of LPS and LOS on neuroinflammation induced by intrastriatal injection of IL-1β into rats, showing that these treatments inhibited a damaging inflammatory response induced by the IL-1β. Our results confirm and expand on those of Davis et al. (Eur. J. Neurosci. 22, 2441–2450, 2005), who reported that the number of ED-1 positive macrophages and microglia, and leukocytes at the site of injury and in the blood, was markedly reduced by IV administration of E. coli 0111:B4 LPS to rats before or after either stereotaxic injection of IL-1β into the striatum to induce neuroinflammation or the induction of a contusion spinal cord injury. Our approach to reducing inflammation in TBI could have significant advantages over administration of broad spectrum anti-inflammatory agents that give rise to concern about potential harmful effects from attenuation of properties of virtually all the brain cells including neural progenitor cells. The results strongly support continued study of post-conditioning with LPS or LOS as potential neuroprotective treatments for TBI.</string>

		<string>Statement of the Problem:
The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a brief neuropsychological assessment that is widely used in many clinical settings, due to its broad coverage of many cognitive skills in a short amount of time. However, the RBANS does not include an index of executive functions, which are cognitive abilities required for the execution of goal directed activities. Prior studies have demonstrated the importance of assessing executive dysfunction, to account for decreased level of functioning. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether an index of executive functions can be derived from subtests composing the RBANS.

Subjects: 
68 veteran &amp; active duty military at a Regional Veterans Affairs (VA) Polytrauma Network Site (PNS) were selected based on a positive TBI screen, using the standard national VA screening assessment. Their median age = 28, education =13, premorbid IQ= 99. 

Procedure:
Subjects completed  the RBANS as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We created an external Executive Composite by averaging z-scores of 12 executive tasks: Trails B, Wisconsin Card Sort, Digit Span Backward, Spatial Span Backward, Letter-Number Sequencing, Shipley Abstraction, D-KEFS Inhibition-Switching, Letter Fluency, Category Switching, NAB Numbers &amp;Letters B, Mazes, and Word Generation.  We estimated premorbid IQ from Shipley Vocabulary and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, and obtained Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventory scores.

Results:
Three RBANS tests correlated r&gt;.5 with the external Executive Composite: Coding, Semantic Fluency, and List Recognition (r=.8, .6, .5, all p&lt;.001). An RBANS Executive Index was calculated by averaging z-scores of these tests. RBANS Executive Index correlated r=.8 with the external Executive Composite. Multiple regression indicated that these three RBANS subtests each contributed uniquely to the correlation with external executive measures. After controlling for Premorbid IQ, Processing Speed, Depression, and Anxiety, the above correlations all remained significant: RBANS Executive Index (partial r=.7, p &lt; .001) and the three RBANS subtests (all partial r &gt;.4, p&lt;001). The RBANS Executive Index correlated most highly with Inhibition-Switching, Letter-Number Sequencing, and Mazes (all r&gt;.5, p&lt;.001).

Conclusion:
The strongest correlates with executive functioning were RBANS Coding, Semantic Fluency and List Recognition. Executive skills tapped by these tests include verbal and spatial organization, cognitive flexibility, and effort. The analyses indicated that general abilities (IQ and processing speed) did not account for the high correlation of these RBANS tests with executive skills. This correlation was also relatively unaffected by depression and anxiety in this sample. These preliminary results suggest the utility of a new RBANS Executive Index, consisting of the mean z-score of these three RBANS tests. Future studies are required to cross-validate this index in other clinical samples. The addition of this index potentially increases the value of the RBANS as a quick assessment of diverse cognitive functions, including executive skills.</string>

		<string>Background
The “Health Surveillance for a New Generation of US Veterans” (New Gen) was one of the first epidemiological studies to examine the health outcomes of Veterans returning from the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan—Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The study began in 2005 and involved a postal survey of a stratified random sample of 59,995 Veterans that included 29,995 Veterans who had been deployed and 30,000 non-deployed Veterans who had served during the same era.   The primary findings revealed that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) were more prevalent in these conflicts than expected.  The current study entitled “Markers for the Identification, Norming, and Differentiation of TBI and PTSD” (MIND) sought to follow up on this study sample with the primary aims of exploring differences in the diagnosis of TBI and PTSD, and help build objective and consistent diagnostic criteria for both conditions.  The recruitment of a sample of the original participants is a major challenge when conducting such population-based studies.  Accordingly, a pilot study was conducted to measure feasibility. Three WRIISC centers participated in the study located at the VA Palo Alto (CA), VA Washington DC (DC), and VA East Orange (NJ).  

Methodology
A sample of 651 Veterans was identified for potential participation (529 males, mean age = 39.1 yr, range = 26.7 to 52.8 yr).   In order to increase the likelihood of recruiting individuals who lived locally, we focused on those whose current address indicated they lived within a 60-mile radius of one of the three study centers (n=445).  All Veterans were sent an Advance Letter providing them with study details.  Telephone screening began two weeks later with the purpose of establishing study criteria, including screening questions related to current PTSD (PCL-C) and history of head injury.  

Results
A total of 362 Veterans were called across a 23-week period.  Of these, 146 Veterans were successfully contacted and 66 individuals were screened.  The major reasons that individuals were not screened included no interest in the study (n=37), losing contact (n=30), and distance from study site (n=30).   Following screening, 36 Veterans were found to be eligible for the study, and 23 were enrolled.  The reasons for not enrolling eligible individuals included losing contact (n=6), failure to keep study appointments (n=3), failure of participants to follow up (n=2) and schedule conflict (n=2).  The most common reasons for non-eligibility included non-deployment TBI (n=9), poor cognition (n=6), and deployment &lt; 30 days (n=5).  

Conclusion
The recruitment rates demonstrate where some of the challenges are when performing population-based studies.  Factors limiting recruitment in such studies include the stringency of inclusion and exclusion criteria, outdated contact information, and the location of study sites.</string>

		<string>Objective : To determine whether two proposed effort measures for the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) predict decrements on other neurocognitive tests.Participants and Methods: 70 military personnel and veterans with positive screens for mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) completed the RBANS (Randolf 1998) as part of a comprehensive battery. We calculated the RBANS effort measures of Silverberg et al 2007 (ES) and Novitsky et al 2012 (EN), and tested whether failing them related to lower scores on other tests (1-tail t-test, alpha=.05).Results : Subjects who failed either effort test scored significantly lower on RBANS measures of attention and memory (Digit Span, Word List, Story and Figure Recall), processing speed (Coding, Semantic Fluency), and Line Orientation, but not other RBANS tests. Subjects failing either effort measure also scored significantly lower on non-RBANS tests of processing speed, dexterity, visual search, visual memory, affect recognition, executive skills, and had higher Beck Anxiety scores. EN and ES were not related to age, education, vocabulary, reported TBI severity indices, posttraumatic stress or depression. On most measures, EN showed larger effect sizes than ES.Conclusions : Test effort is not a unitary factor that affects all domains equally during testing. EN and ES are expected to correlate with the RBANS attention and memory tasks, from which they are calculated. However, failing EN and ES was also associated with lower RBANS and non-RBANS measures of processing speed, memory, visual-spatial, fine-motor and executive skills. This verifies the relevance of these embedded effort measures to a broader range of neurocognitive assessments. Effect sizes for EN and ES were consistent with other studies suggesting that EN may be a psychometrically stronger measure of effort. These findings also prompt future studies to identify both neurologic and motivational contributors to poor effort, which may be addressed during feedback and treatment.</string>

		<string>Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI), known as the “signature injury” of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, is a serious public health problem among veterans and active duty military personnel in the United States. Since 2002, the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System (VAPAHCS) has actively conducted a Prospective TBI Clinical Tracking study (CTF) as part of the national TBI registry and tracking system. CTF is a multi-site, longitudinal study conducted among TBI patients injured in theater, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF/OEF) as well as other situations from date of injury up to 20 years post-injury. Data collected in this study include: etiology of TBI with demographics, injury severity, neurological functioning, associated injuries, life satisfaction, neurobehavioral and post-traumatic stress symptomatology, and outcomes.

Objective: To create a master database and to analyze the descriptive and observational data.

Methods: Participants include consenting Military and Veterans age 18 and older with confirmed TBI diagnosis. Information was collected through patient interviews, questionnaires, review of patients’ medical and service records, and follow-up interviews at years 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. A descriptive analysis was conducted on patients who enrolled from 2002 through 2012.

Results: A total of 196 participants have been enrolled to date with an average of 18 participants per year. The majority of participants are male, 187 (95%). Grouping by age, the 19-34 year-old cohort comprised 137 (70%) of the population. Age-group was selected based on the eligibility of the military service. One-hundred and twelve (57%) participants have severe TBI, followed by 55 (28%) with mild TBI (mTBI), and 29 (15%) with moderate TBI. Nine out of 196 participants had both, head and spinal cord injuries. Ninety-seven (50%) of the TBIs occurred in OIF/OEF and, specifically, 78 out of 97 (80%) of the TBIs that occurred in theater were blast related. Thirty-eight (48%) of those blast-associated injuries were mTBI. A chi-square analysis that looked at brain injury severity where injury occurred, revealed a significantly greater proportion of moderate and severe injuries occurred out of theater 84% (p &lt;0.05). Among blast participants wearing protection (helmet and helmet/body armor), 90% of TBIs were protected.

Conclusion: The analysis of the data reveals that half of the blast related injuries were associated with mTBI among the 19-34 year-old participants. Most of the blast associated injuries were protected.</string>

		<string>BACKGROUND: Nearly two-thirds of injured US soldiers sent from Iraq to Walter Reed Army Medical Center have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Many of these servicemen and women are also diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The co-occurrence of mild TBI and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is of great scientific interest given the number OEF/OIF veterans returning to civilian life. To date, few imaging studies have attempted to compare and contrast the neurological changes that occur in TBI and PTSD. Sustained efforts in this domain will likely reveal neurological similarities and differences that contribute to an understanding of their comorbidity. This study investigates the co-occurrence of TBI and PTSD in Veterans seen at The War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. The goal of WRIISC is to understand the etiology of these disorders, make connections between brain states and their cognitive sequelae, and contribute knowledge toward rehabilitation efforts. 

METHODOLOGY: Participants (n = 43; TBI = 6; PTSD only = 9; TBI/PTSD = 28; healthy controls = 10) were scanned in a 3T GE MRI (high-resolution T1 anatomical, 30 direction DTI sequence) and completed a battery of neuropsychological tests focusing on PTSD, TBI, and memory. DTI data were analyzed with custom software for the creation of tensor maps, identification of white matter tracts, and the extraction fractional anisotropy values (FA) values.  

RESULTS: Pilot results revealed a decrease in average FA, particularly in the cingulum, and anterior thalamic projections, in patients TBI + PTSD compared to patients with PTSD only. CONCLUSIONS: Current results suggest that TBI + PTSD patients may have neurological damage in key fiber tracts beyond that of individuals with only PTSD. Further research is needed to evaluate the implications of this difference in terms of health outcomes for Veterans, as individuals with both TBI and PTSD might be at higher risk for other health problems.</string>

		<string>Rationale: Travel to healthcare centers that provide specialized assessment and treatment can be burdensome for people who live far away, especially those with cognitive and emotional difficulties. This obstacle frequently results in reduced healthcare for those in need. To bridge the gap, several telecommunications media have been suggested, of which, telephone is the most widely available format.  We assessed the reliability of neuropsychological testing by telephone in a sample of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Method: 23 veterans with a history of moderate to severe TBI completed two test sessions, several weeks apart, in a test-retest protocol. The battery included standard, verbally administered tests of attention, working memory, processing speed, language, memory, and executive skills, as well as auditory-verbal adaptations of trail-making, visual search, and spatial reasoning tasks.

Results: All tests had moderate to high test-retest reliability (r = 0.7 to 0.9). As expected, practice effects were found for two verbal memory tasks; all other tests did not differ significantly between trials.

Conclusions: These findings verify that testing by telephone can provide reliable, stable scores across multiple neurocognitive domains, even in individuals with significant deficits. The results also support further development of auditory-verbal tests of visual and spatial abilities.  Future validation studies should assess the equivalence and limitations of testing by telephone, compared to traditional in-person testing.</string>

		<string>Background: In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs started to encourage the use of the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 Participation Index (M2PI) to better identify the long-term psychosocial consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. As in the civilian sector, the vast majority of TBIs in returning Veterans are classified as mild in nature.  While the M2PI has generally showed good interrater agreement, Malec (2004) demonstrated that civilians who sustained a mild TBI generally rate themselves as more impaired on the M2PI than clinicians. At this time, little is known about the psychometric properties of the M2PI in the Veteran population. 

Methodology:  The 144 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans (mean age=31.6 years, 134 males) included in this study were referred for neuropsychological evaluation following the completion of the Comprehensive TBI Evaluation. Veterans with a history of moderate or severe traumatic brain injury were excluded. The M2PI clinician and patient rating forms were administered as part of a collaborative research database across several VA hospitals. Due to variation in administration procedures, item 7 was replaced with an objective rating of current employment status to determine a mean score, but excluded from rater comparisons. 

Results:  Veterans reported greater impairment, activity limitations, and participation restrictions than clinicians across all items on the measure. On the 8-item M2PI, Veterans endorsed a mean total score of 11.50 (SD=5.83, range=1-27), whereas clinicians assigned a mean total score of 6.26 (SD=4.88, range=0-22). Correlations among the two raters ranged from rs=0.25 (item 5, residence) to rs=0.57 (item 2, social contact) across items, with an overall correlation of rs=0.53. When symptom amplification was indicated on a separately administered symptom validity indicator (i.e., MMPI-II FBS≥26), both Veterans and clinicians rated items 2 (social contact), 3 (leisure and recreation), and 4 (self-care) as significantly more problematic (p&lt;.01) relative to Veterans who passed the symptom validity indicator and the respective clinician ratings. 

Conclusion:  Clinician and Veteran raters demonstrated weak to fair reliability across items and total score on the M2PI. Consistent with Malec (2004), Veterans reported higher levels of impairment, activity limitations, and participation restrictions relative to clinician ratings. While symptom amplification did not significantly impact interrater agreement, higher clinician ratings on the M2PI for those Veterans who demonstrated possible symptom amplification, suggests the need for more objective indicators of functional outcome.</string>

		<string>The War Related Illnesses and Injuries Studies Center (WRIISC) at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Healthcare Center is one of three WRIISC sites in the nation. The WRIISC focuses on the health needs of post-deployment veterans. Post-deployment veterans are seen by a team of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, neurologists, neuroradiologists, nurses, M.D.’s, researchers, and educators in order to best meet their unique health concerns. The WRIISC research team has implemented a “bench to bedside” approach into their practice. This means that WRIISC researchers are dedicated to integrating the knowledge gained through research into clinical practice here at WRIISC. The following case study is one example of an opportunity for such “bench to bedside” implementation.

W.J. is a 43 year-old, Filipino, retired, married, US Navy (’90-’10) veteran male with 12 years of education who came to the WRIISC with history of significant head trauma, complaints of chronic back and knee pain, a diagnosis of PTSD, and cognitive complaints. During his military service, he stated that he hit his head on metal valves on his ship several times and experienced post-concussive symptoms but no loss of consciousness. He also reported that in 1991, while fighting a fire on his ship, he fell from the upper deck to the lower deck, hurting his back and hitting his head. W.J. was unsure if he lost consciousness during this episode, but did feel lightheaded, nauseous and dizzy. He was, however, immediately sent back to fight the fire and did not seek medical attention after this incident. It was after this head injury that W.J. noticed considerable changes in his personality and mood. He then reported new symptoms of emotional lability which included crying much more easily, became quick to anger, and increased engagement in risky and impulsive behaviors. Concurrent with these symptoms he reported becoming severely depressed. Prior to evaluation at the WRIISC, W.J. believed his biggest problem was his PTSD, which he felt was affecting his mood and behavior. During his visit to the WRIISC W.J. was given an extensive neuropsychological battery and was found to be impaired in auditory memory on the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II Standard Form). He experienced difficulty on the CVLT even when cued, and gave numerous false positives on the recognition trial of this task. The patient also demonstrated impairments in executive functioning on the Trails B exam. The executive functioning deficits he exhibited were consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD . Neuroimaging demonstrated numerous scattered bifrontal white matter signal abnormalities, which can be seen in the setting of prior head trauma. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) also demonstrated abnormal bifrontal fiber tracts, which has been demonstrated in TBI patients . 

Because it has been found that people with frontal lobe damage can be more impulsive, have trouble with emotional regulation, have executive functioning problems, present with personality changes, and present with numerous false positives on recognition tasks, it is suggested that W.J.’s presentation may be related to frontal lobe injury in place of, or in addition to his PTSD. By implementing this bench to bedside practice, we are gaining insight into potential target areas to focus cognitive rehabilitation that the diagnosis of PTSD alone may have excluded. As the symptoms of PTSD and TBI can very similar and difficult to disentangle, our case presents potential neuroimaging and neurocognitive testing approaches that may aid in the diagnosis and management of patients with both conditions.</string>

		<string>The War Related Illnesses and Injuries Studies Center (WRIISC) at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Healthcare Center is one of three WRIISC sites in the nation. The WRIISC focuses on the health needs of post-deployment veterans. Post-deployment veterans are seen by a team of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, neurologists, neuroradiologists, nurses, M.D.’s, researchers, and educators in order to best meet their unique health concerns. In our effort to develop research techniques for the potential benefit of our WRIISC patients, we have developed an image processing pipeline that incorporates a number of automated and semi-automated advanced neuroimaging processing tools. This poster will present them along with our developed workflow.
While potential sequelae of traumatic brain injury is well established as a clinical concern for deployed and veteran population, specific neuroimaging techniques that can be routinely evaluated in the clinical setting are lacking. Disjoint work evaluating variants of diffusion tensor imaging, white matter hyperintensity measurement, brain volume analysis, brain perfusion mapping and quantitative susceptibility mapping have been presented in the TBI literature, however a solution that performs these various forms of image processing, so that the data can then be evaluated in the context an individual patient’s clinical presentation is not available. We feel that until such methods can be performed in an automated or semi-automated manner, any evaluation of these methods’ ability to aid in clinical diagnosis and management will be limited.
We have established an image processing pipeline that performs brain volumetric analysis, with brain region segmentation, white matter hyperintensity analysis, diffusion tensor white matter tract analysis, and quantitative susceptibility mapping. We have integrated the process such that only a few steps require user interaction, mainly for the purposes of quality assurance. These processing steps are performed using a variety of publicly available image processing packages that are well established in the scientific literature, with the addition of various program elements to integrate their data workflow. The result is a set of images and data that convey various metrics derived from neuroimaging which can readily be integrated into the evaluation of individual subjects or groups.
In conjunction with the extensive neurocognitive testing and multidisciplinary clinical information obtained by groups such as the Palo Alto WRIISC, we believe the results from image processing pipelines, as the one described here will enable a new level of diagnosis and management for clinicians caring for patients with TBI.</string>
